# TruRecruit-Mobile

This mobile app is used by the recruiter to scan a QR code that contains professional information of TruRecruit's user such as 
their name, school that they went to, where are they currently working, where they have worked in the past, 
and of course their resume. 

The mobile app of TruRecruit is built using React Native and Firebase. To handle data flow I incorporated React Redux 
into the mobile app. 

And here are screenshots of the app
